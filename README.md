# Skneekers
Skneekers will aggregate data from eBay sold items and display them for users for easy access.

## STATUS
Currently most of the backend is written. Graph file is the template from go-gart, it needs more work.

### Features added since repo was created:
- [x] scraper using goquery
- [x] graph using go-chart
- [x] web server

### TO-DO
- [ ] more paginations (currently eBay only allows 4)
- [x] support for any brand, model and size. (currently only static link)
- [ ] Front-end, initially just some responsive CSS and HTML, and potentially in the future a framework.
- [ ] (to be considered) prices from other sites.
